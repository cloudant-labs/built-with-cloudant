* [Radiopurity](http://radiopurity.cloudant.com/rp/_design/persephone/index.html) - another Science app. Currently under construction, used to store assay results for materials considered in low-radioactive background physics experiments.

## Modules

## Command-line tools
* [Edelweiss: Using Views/Lists to select documents that match criteria](https://gist.github.com/gadamc/4965877) -- check the comment for this commit. i think this could be an example of how things were done before lucene-search and perhaps one should instead build a proper search index.
